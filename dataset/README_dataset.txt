In this study we integrated plant antimicrobial peptide (AMP) sequences from six authoritative sources: APD3, DBAASP, DRAMP, PlantPepDB, dbAMP, and a curated export from NCBI Protein focused on plant-derived peptides or precursor proteins. The working snapshots used here comprise 268 sequences from APD3 (≈7–178 amino acids, median ≈36–37), 336 from DBAASP (≈2–121, median ≈31), 21 from DRAMP (≈7–63, median ≈41), and 13 richly annotated records from PlantPepDB (including species, family, functional labels, and literature fields). The dbAMP antibacterial export contains 7,625 sequences in total (overall span ≈1–1,256), of which only the plant-relevant portion was considered for cross-checking. The NCBI Protein aggregate used for background and precursor retrieval contains 4,850 entries with substantially longer lengths (≈7–1,722, median ≈392).

As to each dataset’s inherent compilation and curation practices, APD3, DBAASP, and DRAMP are manually curated AMP repositories emphasizing experimentally supported activities and standardized annotations (sequence, structure/modification, and bibliographic metadata). PlantPepDB is a plant-focused, literature-curated resource that records species, peptide family, functional evidence, and citation details. dbAMP is a comprehensive AMP repository that combines manual curation with functional annotations and auxiliary identification tools to broaden coverage. NCBI Protein serves as an aggregate of protein records from multiple primary sources (e.g., GenBank/RefSeq, UniProt-derived feeds, PDB), suitable for wide-scope queries of plant precursors or peptides used as background and comparison material. All dataset sizes reported above reflect the exact files analyzed in this work.
