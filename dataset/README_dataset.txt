Below we provide plant-focused, source-specific descriptions of the datasets used in this study.

APD3 (Antimicrobial Peptide Database). APD3 is a manually curated AMP repository emphasizing experimentally supported activities and standardized peptide descriptors (sequence, physicochemical properties, structural/bridge patterns), with organismal origin recorded to enable plant-specific retrieval. In our snapshot, the APD3 file contains 268 sequences with lengths spanning approximately 7–178 amino acids (median ≈36.5; mean ≈39.08). APD3 records originate from peer-reviewed literature; entries are screened for antimicrobial evidence and normalized nomenclature, making it suitable for isolating plant-derived AMPs through the source/organism metadata.

DBAASP (Database of Antimicrobial Activity and Structure of Peptides). DBAASP is a manually annotated resource that integrates peptide sequences with experimental activity measurements, assay conditions, structural information, and chemical modifications. Organism/source fields allow identification of plant-origin peptides and plant-relevant families (e.g., defensins, orbitides). Our snapshot includes 336 sequences (≈2–121 aa; median ≈31.0; mean ≈33.26). By design, DBAASP emphasizes direct experimental activity reporting and standardized assay metadata, which supports high-confidence inclusion of plant AMPs and facilitates cross-database triangulation.

DRAMP (Data Repository of Antimicrobial Peptides). DRAMP is an open, manually curated AMP warehouse that collates natural and synthetic peptides (including patented and clinically relevant entries) with broad functional annotations and family classifications. Organismal source and functional tags enable plant-subset extraction. The present DRAMP FASTA snapshot contains 21 sequences (≈7–63 aa; median ≈40.5; mean ≈36.80). DRAMP’s curation integrates literature abstraction and standardized sequence/annotation formatting, making it a complementary source for plant peptide families.

PlantPepDB (Plant Peptide Database). PlantPepDB is a plant-centric, literature-curated resource that aggregates peptide entries with species names, peptide family (e.g., orbitides), functional labels (including antimicrobial activity), and evidence levels (e.g., “experimental evidence at protein level”), plus citation identifiers. Our tabular snapshot comprises 13 richly annotated records (one record per line with species, family, function, evidence, and reference fields). Its plant-exclusive scope and explicit evidence grading are particularly useful for validating plant AMP provenance and mapping sequence-to-species/family relationships.

dbAMP. dbAMP is a comprehensive AMP repository that combines manual literature curation with broad functional annotations and auxiliary computational identifiers across taxa. Taxonomic (organism) metadata and curated activity tags allow focusing on plant-derived AMPs where available. The antibacterial FASTA export provided here contains 1,525 sequences in total (lengths ≈1–1,256 aa; median ≈21; mean ≈35.51). Within dbAMP, plant relevance is typically supported through species/taxonomy fields linked to the curated literature; this facilitates cross-checking plant AMPs against other domain-specific resources.

NCBI Protein (plant-focused aggregate). NCBI Protein aggregates protein sequences from multiple primary sources (e.g., GenBank/RefSeq, UniProt-derived feeds, PDB). For plant AMPs, it is particularly useful for retrieving precursor proteins (e.g., defensin precursors) and confirming organismal provenance. The snapshot used here contains 4,850 entries with longer lengths overall (≈7–1,722 aa; median ≈392; mean ≈332.91), reflecting the prevalence of full-length precursors and domain-containing proteins. Records include standardized accessioning, organism taxonomy, and cross-references that support plant-specific filtering and linkage to mature AMP regions reported in specialized AMP databases.

APD3/DBAASP/DRAMP contribute manually curated, activity-anchored AMP records with organism fields; PlantPepDB supplies plant-exclusive, evidence-graded annotations with species/family granularity; dbAMP broadens literature coverage with taxonomy-aware curation across taxa (enabling plant extraction); and NCBI Protein offers a unifying accession/taxonomy backbone for plant precursor retrieval and sequence validation.
